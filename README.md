# PassShootScore
A football management game, inspired by the Football Manager series.

Take an underdog team and grow them into a powerhouse. Take a financially struggling team and utilize the youth while cutting the wage bill. Lots of potential scenarios to play.

Built on top of my personal [Sprunth Framework](https://github.com/Sprunth/SprunthFramework)

Uses the wonderful [Rant](https://github.com/TheBerkin/Rant) library to procedurally generate all the text. From player and team names to news stories, all of it will be procedurally generated.
